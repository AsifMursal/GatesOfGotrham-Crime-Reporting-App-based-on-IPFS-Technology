## Introduction

The Crime Reporting Website is a decentralized platform built on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) technology that allows users to report crimes and share information in a secure and immutable manner. By leveraging the decentralized nature of IPFS, the website ensures data integrity, censorship resistance, and privacy for both the reporters and the victims.

## Features

- **Anonymous Reporting**: Users can submit crime reports anonymously, ensuring their safety and privacy.
- **Secure Data Storage**: All crime reports and related information are stored using IPFS, providing data integrity and resistance against tampering.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: The website is built on IPFS, which distributes data across multiple nodes, making it highly resilient to censorship and single points of failure.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search and filter crime reports based on various criteria such as location, crime type, and date.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users have the ability to authenticate themselves to access additional features and review their submitted reports.
- **Interactive Map**: A map interface allows users to view crime incidents geographically and provides visual representations of crime patterns.
